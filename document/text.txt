String methods
slice() - extracts the part of string and return the extracted part in new string .(end is not included )

substring(7 , 13)- its is similar to slice but value less than 0 is treated as 0
If you omit the second parameter, substring() will slice out the rest of the string.

substr() - it is similar to slice() . The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.

The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:
By default, the replace() method replaces only the first match:
If you want to replace all value the use /g flag

split() A string can be converted to an array with the split() method:
If the separator is omitted, the returned array will contain the whole string in index [0].
If the separator is "", the returned array will be an array of single characters:

replace() - replace the string with another string and return a  new string
Syntax - text1 = “My name is Sneha”
Text2 = text1.replace(“Sneha”, “Annsh”)

replaceAll() - replaces all strings present in a sentence

toUpperCase() -convert string to upper case

toLowerCase() - converts string to lower case

concat() - add 2 strings 
Syntax - 
let text1 = “Hello”
Let text2 = text1.concat(“ ”, “world!”)
 

trim() - removes whitespace from both the sides

trimStart() - removes space from start

trimEnd() - removes space from end

padStart() - its pads a string from the start until it reached its given length
Eg- let text = “5”
Text = text.padStart(4,”0”) -                         op - 0005

padEnd() - pads string from ends

String search methods 

indexOf() - give the index value of the given string in first occurrence

lastIndexOf() - search the string from the last reference

It the search string doesn’t match then both of the methods will return  -1

indexOf() and lastIndexOf() - both methods takes a second parameters and begin from that value
Eg - indexOf(“locate”, 15) 

search() - the search method search the string from the first reference it and also it searches for regular expressions 

The only diff between search() and indexOf() is that the search() will not have any second parameters and the indexOf() doesn’t find for expressions
